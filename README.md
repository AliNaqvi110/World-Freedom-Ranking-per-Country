<p>The dashboard has been designed utilizing Freedom Rankings per Country from 2013 to 2022 dataset in Power BI, resulting in a fully interactive dashboard. The left section of the dashboard comprises a year selector that allows users to choose any year and display results based on the selected year. At the top, a dataset label is positioned, and below it are a number of scorecards that show the total number of countries, territories, and regions. These scorecards also provide information on the top-most and least-most freed regions.</p>

<p>A toggle button for changing the background of the entire dashboard is included in the design. The first bar chart displays the total freedom value by year, illustrating which year had the most freedom of individual rights. The second bar chart shows the total freedom value by each region, demonstrating that Europe is the most freed region when compared to other regions.</p>

<p>A pie chart is also included in the dashboard, displaying the percentage of the total number of countries or territories that are Free (F), Not Free (NF), and Partially Free (PF). Additionally, a region selector is present, enabling users to select different types of regions to display the visuals based on that selection.</p>

<p>The bottom left section of the dashboard features a bar chart showcasing the countries or territories with the least personal autonomy and individual rights. Somalia tops the list of countries with the least number of personal autonomy and individual rights. The bar chart positioned next to it indicates the top countries or territories with the least freedom of expression and belief rights. Tibet and North Korea occupy the top of that list. Lastly, the dashboard includes a map displaying the top countries with the most political rights.</p>
